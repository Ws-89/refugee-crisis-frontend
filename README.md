Refugee crisis multipurpose system
This is the code I wrote during learning redux (on my github repository you can also find backend of this project)

The code will appear as the learning progresses and will be divided into parts as:

Humanitarian aid transport planning
Refugee registration
Refugee lodging
Refugee transport planning
